While not new, integrating security into the everyday for everyone was covered in a few talks
 - why do we have security bugs, aren't they all "bugs"?
 - security is everyone's responsibility
 - sharing security tools with other teams.
Empowerment is a good thing(tm), can we make it easier to consume security and increase "healthy skepticism" (shout out to @investigatory).

Containers and the orchestration were given some attention with a good [101](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/bsidessf2020/02/BSidesSF%20-%20Checking%20your%20--privileged%20container%20-%202020:02:23.pdf) that included a link to a great blog post about the building blocks! And on the orchestration side from [https://connorgilbert.com/](https://connorgilbert.com/) .

[Better security access to AWS](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/bsidessf2020/83/How%20to%20Kill%20an%20Access%20Key%20rev%2020200223.pdf) - i.e.: get rid of access keys - noted a honey pot github repo that took 12 minutes from a commit with an - don't do this at home - aws key and attempted use.

After a course from @EdwardTufte that enabled me to be more appreciative/attentive to layout of data and  (at least outside of this blog post) to my own content! picked up tips from two talks on writing and visualizing security content. Note to self to try using [logarithmic graphs](https://www.cyentia.com/research/) when appropriate and have content read back to me by the computer as an editing tool (@e_briannica).

@theckman - in what was afaik a new feature of bsidesSF "off the record sessions" - shared a riveting story about an attack and response from the defender perspective. Nicely done, with great context; not often I get to hear a story like this. 

Lucky to sign-up for/attend a workshop on Saturday on BELK (beats, ElasticStack,Logstash and Kibana) and zeek that included an intro, sample dataset to explore and a CTF (16th/23). Can't help ponder why we can't control what an app/service is supposed to do. Seems backward to say: go out there and play and if you get into trouble we'll review what happened and try and "clean it up".

Utilizing a technique from @DanielMiessler...
"Sunlight is great disinfectant" in relation so sharing security information/skills/tools - Flee from Gusto, day one keynote.
